## Steps to Create Project

1. **Project Structure Setup**
    - Created client and server folders.

2. **Client Folder Structure**
    - Created a `src` folder within the client folder.

3. **Client Assets**
    - Inside the `src` folder, created an `index.html` file.
    - Created an `assets` folder for storing fonts, images, scripts, and styles.

4. **Asset Folders**
    - Inside the `assets` folder, created separate subfolders for `fonts`, `images`, `scripts`, and `styles`.

5. **Package Files**
    - Created `package.json` files in the client and server directories.
    - Also, created a `package.json` file in the root directory.

6. **Package File Configuration**
    - Filled out the `package.json` files with the required fields, including dependencies and devDependencies.

7. **Dependency Installation**
    - Began the installation of necessary dependencies and devDependencies such as React, TypeScript, Vite, SASS, etc.

8. **Script Configuration**
    - Updated the scripts section in the `package.json` files to specify the build, start, and other custom commands.

9. **Vite Configuration**
    - Created a `vite.config.ts` file in the client directory and set the location for the `index.html` file.

10. **TypeScript Configuration**
    - Created a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript settings for the project.

11. **Version Control Setup**
    - Created a `.gitignore` file to ignore files like `node_modules`, `temp`, and `build` to prevent unnecessary files from being committed to version control.
